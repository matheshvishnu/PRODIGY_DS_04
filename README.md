**Title: Social Media Sentiment Analysis and Visualization**

OVERVIEW:
This task focuses on analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in social media data to gain insights into public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. Sentiment analysis, a subfield of natural language processing (NLP), involves the process of identifying, extracting, and quantifying sentiment from text data.

Task Implemented:

1] Data Exploration: We delve into the Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis dataset to understand its structure, features, and contents.

2] Data Preprocessing: We preprocess the text data to clean and prepare it for sentiment analysis. This involves tasks such as text normalization, tokenization, and removing noise.

3] Sentiment Analysis: Using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library, we analyze the sentiment of each tweet in the dataset. This process involves classifying tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories.

4] Visualization: We utilize popular data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful visualizations that illustrate sentiment trends, sentiment distribution, and sentiment over time. These visualizations help us gain a deeper understanding of public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands on Twitter.
